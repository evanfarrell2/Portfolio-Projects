### Nashville Housing Project 

### Goal:
- Clean up messy housing data based in Nashville and prepare it for visualisation

### Tools used:
- SQL
- Excel
- Tableau Public

### Process:
As this was a project I took from alex the Analyst on youtube, I downloaded the raw data from his respository on github so I could showcase my skills through this project.

- Cleaned the raw data via Excel and SQL
- Performed basic queries to format the data for Tableau
- Created a dashboard on Tableau Public to share my project insights
